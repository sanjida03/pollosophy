# pollosophy
CMSC 447 Project

Goal: The primary goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to participate in pre-made themed polls, view poll results, and engage in discussions through a comment section on each poll.

Description: In the fast-paced digital world of today, deep conversations about a wide range of subjects are getting harder to find. This lack of serious dialogue can lead to a less informed and active society, thereby limiting growth and understanding among varied groups. We propose developing a web application that blends the depth of meaningful conversations with the fast-paced, immediate feedback of polls. This platform seeks to be both useful and interesting, acting as a spark for insightful discussion on various subjects.
This platform is intellectually stimulating and practically useful, catalyzing insightful discussions on diverse subjects. By featuring curated conversation starters, an advanced polling system, moderated discussion forums, and contributions from subject matter experts, the application aims to spark curiosity, encourage critical thinking, and foster empathy among its users. The platform will incorporate gamification elements to incentivize thoughtful contributions and challenges to promote engagement with diverse viewpoints.
